Part 1) Data Collection:
The words "toddler", "teenagers", "adults" are searched on images.google.com
and corresponding images are extracted using javascript.
Train and validation foledrs are created in a 3:1 ratio of number of images.

Part 2) Model Training:
I built Convolutional Neural Network using keras with tensorflow.
All the images are resized to a fixed length and width and passed to the first layer of CNN.
My model is : Conv2D, pool, Conv2D, pool, Flatten, Dense, Dense(softmax)
Optimizer used is Adam with learning rate of 0.05

Part 3) Results
The predictions are stored in a dataframe, which when left joined with the given sample test dataframe produces images in the correct order.
